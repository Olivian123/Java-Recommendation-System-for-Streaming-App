#Java Recommendation System for Streaming App
This project implements a Recommendation System for a Streaming App, focusing on music, podcasts, and audiobooks. The system incorporates user behavior and stream creator data to provide personalized recommendations. Input is received through a series of commands and processed accordingly.

Functionality
The system processes the following commands:

ADD: Adds a new stream to the system.
LIST: Lists streams based on specified criteria.
LISTEN: Records when a user listens to a stream.
DELETE: Deletes a stream from the system.
RECOMMEND: Provides recommendations based on user preferences and behavior.
SURPRISE: Provides a random surprise recommendation.
Implementation Details
Language: Java
Design Patterns: Utilizes various design patterns such as Singleton, Iterator, Proxy, and Command for a compact and robust implementation.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Designed with OOP principles to ensure maintainability and extensibility.
Input Handling: Accepts input through a series of commands stored and processed by the system.
Usage
To use the system:

Ensure the necessary input files are available in the specified directory.
Execute the program, providing the necessary command line arguments.
Enter commands as needed to interact with the system.
Note
This project was implemented in Java due to its support for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), providing advantages in structuring the recommendation system. The utilization of design patterns ensures a compact and robust implementation.
